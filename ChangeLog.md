## 1.0.4
* Update dependencies
* Added support for nested loops

## 1.0.3
* Available on npm via `postcss-for-var`

## 1.0.2
* Changed the plugin syntax to use `@i` instead of `$i`.
  I can't see this to ever be compliant with the official PostCSS project as I
  assume `@anything` is to be considered a rule.

## 1.0.1
* Update examples and tests to contain valid CSS

## 1.0.0
* Update according to the plugin guidelines
* Bump to major release, since in 0.2.0 breaking changes were introduced and alas were not bumped.

## 0.2.0
* Change `to` keyword to mean `inclusively`
* Remove `through` keyword
Sorry, these are the breaking changes.

## 0.1.0
* Add `by` keyword

## 0.0.1
* First version of a plugin
